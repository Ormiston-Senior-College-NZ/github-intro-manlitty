## My Whakapapa  
Me and my family has been in New Zealand for over 10 years now **(soon to be 11 years in August on my birthday)**. 
I have two sibilings, both older and younger. My older brother, 21 (turning 22 in April) goes to UOA, while my younger sister (13) studies at Mission Heights Junior College. I was born in the Philippines in Makati City near the Capital City of the Philippines Manila.

**Where is your family comes from**  
My family comes from the Philippines.
**Where were you born?**  
I was born in the Philippines.  
**What languages (besides English) you speak at home?**  
_I can speak Tagalog but with a mixed of English._


**My Interests**  
What do you like to do when you are not at school? e.g.  
I enjoy watching a lot of basketball, talking to friends through Discord and other forms of communication as well as watching football. I've started to become invested into football and now have a team to support, which is Chelsea, Barcelona and RB Leipzig in the Top 3 Leagues of Football. I also enjoyed coding last year, especially using HTML & CSS. Finally, I also like researching about topics I want to learn about like geopolitics and so on.

**My Future Goals**
_What would you like to achieve?_  
At the end of this school year, I want to achieve the rank score that I deserve to apply for UOA or other top ranking universities in New Zealand. On the sport side, I would also love to be a part of the A team and winning our games to qualify for Auckland Regionals and potentially be crowned the best school in New Zealand through team play. By the time I turn 30, I want to have a job that I love doing which is somewhere around Software and computers (not to sure which field in particular but I would love to work in), having a family around my 30s as well as playing basketball at a competitive level _(if possible)_. But my dream in particular is to become a basketball player and raise a family.
